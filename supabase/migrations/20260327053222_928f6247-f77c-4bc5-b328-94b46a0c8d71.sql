DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- Fix 2: Prevent users from changing their email in profiles (privilege escalation prevention)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR UPDATE
TO public
USING (auth.uid() = id)
